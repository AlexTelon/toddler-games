# Color games for my son

My son just turned 1 years old and is very interested in his fathers keyboard. He can play with it unplugged but it would be more fun to have something happen on screen so he can practice his coordination.

So here I will create a few simple "games" to do that.

My keyboard is configurable with qmk and I have created a layer in which all keys are alphanumberic. Meaning he cannot physically use the keyboard to navigate away from a fullscreen webpage. Which is convinient since otherwise he might mess things up. So if you want to try the games on kids you should do something similar.

[colors.html](colors.html) simply changes colors in a repeating pattern when a key is pressed. There is no 'game' element. Just learning that typing on the keyboard produces a change on the screen.
